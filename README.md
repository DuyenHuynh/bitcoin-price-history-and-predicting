## 1. Goals of the project
üìà For my graduation project, I have chosen a topic that has fascinated me for quite some time: the history of Bitcoin and its price prediction. The first time I heard about Bitcoin was in a short lecture related to E-commerce at the university lately in 2012. Over 10 years since then, recently intrigued by financial markets and cutting-edge technology, I find cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, to be a compelling subject due to their disruptive potential and ever-evolving nature.

‚Çø Bitcoin, since its inception in 2009, has experienced a remarkable journey filled with rapid growth, significant volatility, and major milestones. Its decentralized nature and use of blockchain technology have not only sparked a new wave of digital finance but have also reshaped discussions around traditional monetary systems. However, predicting Bitcoin's price remains a challenging task due to its high volatility and sensitivity to various factors, including regulatory news, market sentiment, and technological developments.

üèÖ In this project, I aim to explore the historical trends of Bitcoin's price movements while applying predictive modeling techniques to forecast future prices. By combining a thorough historical analysis with data-driven predictive methods, I hope to shed light on the factors that influence Bitcoin's value and contribute to the broader understanding of cryptocurrency markets. This project will not only enable me to deepen my knowledge of financial modeling and data analysis but will also satisfy my curiosity about Bitcoin and its opportunity in the future, which can also refer for other cryptocurrencies.
